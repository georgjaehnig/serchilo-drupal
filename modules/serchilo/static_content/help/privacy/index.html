<p>When using [site:name], the following data gets recorded.</p>

<h3>Generally</h3>

<p>When accessing web pages on [site:url-brief] or calling a [site:name] shortcut, the time and the full IP address gets recorded for the maximum time of 30 hours. (A daily cron job deletes all logs older than 6 hours.) This is due to prevent flood attacks.</p>

<p>One exception: If the access causes an error on the Apache server, the IP remains logged, according to Apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#errorlog">error log configuration</a>.</p>

<h3>Calling a shortcut, without browsing the website</h3>

<p>The following data gets recorded when calling a shortcut and directly being redirected to the target URL – for instance when using [site:name] <a href="/help/integration">via a browser plugin</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the access time</li>
  <li>the shortcut id (as in <a href="/shortcuts/1/google-com">/shortcuts/<strong>1</strong>/google-com</a>)</li>
  <li>the namespace id (an internal pointer to the shortcut's namespace)</li>
</ul>
<p> This data is used to collect statistics about shortcut usage, in order to improve their ranking in the autocomplete function and on the <a href="/shortcuts">shortcuts</a> overview.</p>

<h3>Browsing the website</h3>

<p>When browsing the website, i.e. when loading pages on www.findfind.it, a local instance of <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> is used. It is set up with the default settings – only IP logging has been restricted to the first two bytes. Additionally, logs older than 3 days get deleted automatically.</p>
