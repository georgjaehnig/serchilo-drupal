<h3>Calling a shortcut, without browsing the website</h3>

<p>The following data gets recorded when calling a shortcut and directly being redirected to the target URL – for instance when using [site:name] <a href="/help/integration">via a browser plugin</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the shortcut id (as in <a href="/shortcuts/1/google-com">/shortcuts/<strong>1</strong>/google-com</a>)</li>
  <li>the namespace id (an internal pointer to the shortcut's namespace)</li>
  <li>the page type (console, url, api)</li>
  <li>the source type (e.g. firefix-addon, opensearch, example)</li>
  <li>whether the default keyword was used</li>
  <li>the access time</li>
  <li>the execution time</li>
</ul>
<p> This data is used to collect statistics about shortcut usage, in order to improve their ranking in the autocomplete function and on the <a href="/shortcuts">shortcuts</a> overview.</p>
